# Anomaly Detection Project

By: Alberto Puentes & Natasha Rivers

In this project, we sought to answer the following questions:

1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?
3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
4. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
5. Which lessons are least accessed?
