# Anomaly Detection Project

By: Alberto Puentes & Natasha Rivers

In this project, we sought to answer the following questions:

1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?
3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
4. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
5. Which lessons are least accessed?

- Student who accessed curriculum  the least:

| User_id      |   times accessed    |   Cohort      |  Program |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| 388          | 8                   |  31           | 2        | 
| 812          | 7                   |  58           | 2        | 
| 956          | 5                   |  139          | 2        | 
| 278          | 4                   |  24           | 2        |

| 879          | 1                   |  135          | 2        | 


    
    ***These are the only users who accessed the curriculum less than 10 times***

- program 2 (Java) seems to have the users that access curriculum the least

<br>

- The topics that post-graduates are continuing to access (by program) are:
    - Program 1 (PHP):
        - javascript-i
        - html-ss
        - spring

    - Program 2 (Java):
        - javascript-i
        - spring
        - html-ss

    - Program 3 (Data Science):
        - my_sql overview
        - classification/overview
        - classification/scale_features_or_not

- The least accessed curriculum pages are:
    - 5-stats/sampling
    - 7-clustering/3-wrangle
    - capstone-workbook
